# Trash-Recycling-Compost-Sorter

This project is a combination of hardware and coding. Mr. Pound has all of the hardware I used for this project, and a photo of my setup is in the respository. To run the computer vision model, the hardware must be setup in that way, V3.py must exist in a folder on the Jetson Nano, and you have to run model0000.py on your computer. I would reccomend Google Cloud Computing for running the model, as other than the cost, it is very effective. For future reference, the password to the Jetson Nano is "Tvdyb.gggh1". Use the Jetson Nano that currently has the Micro SD card in it, and I'd reccomend using that Micro SD card so that you already have my files. One challenge I had was connecting to the Branson Wifi, but that Nano should be set up on KBS-Student now. Let me know if you have any other questions!
